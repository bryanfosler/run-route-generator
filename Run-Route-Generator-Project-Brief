Run Route Generator — Project Brief Summary
Based on our past conversations, here's everything you discussed compiled into a single document:
🎯 Project Goals

Reduce friction in finding new running routes around Madison
Match routes to your preferences — distance range, elevation, surface type
Support both door-to-door AND drive-to-trailhead options
Export routes to your Garmin watch via GPX files
Build on skills from the Reddit Research Tool


📥 Core Inputs (What You'll Enter)
InputDescriptionStart locationDefault to home, option for customDistance rangeMin/max miles (e.g., 10-12 mi), with slight flexibilityElevation preferenceFlat, rolling, hilly, or "any"Route typeLoop vs. out-and-backDriving toggle"Willing to drive X minutes to trailhead"

📤 Core Outputs (What You'll Get)

Ranked route suggestions that match your criteria
Route details: distance, elevation gain, estimated time, surface type
Interactive map showing the route
GPX export button to download for Garmin sync


🛠 Technical Stack (Matches Your Reddit Tool Pattern)
Frontend: HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript + Leaflet.js for maps
Backend: Node.js + Express (same as Reddit tool)
Testing: ngrok for local tunneling
APIs to integrate:

OpenRouteService (free) — Route calculation + elevation
Leaflet + OpenStreetMap — Map display (free)
Strava API (optional later) — Popular segments

📅 Development Phases
Phase 1 (Week 1): Basic map display + hardcoded test route
Phase 2 (Week 2): Route generation API + distance filtering
Phase 3 (Week 3): Elevation prefs + GPX export
Phase 4 (Week 4+): Multiple suggestions, ranking, polish

❓ Open Questions (Decide While Building)

Prioritize roads or trails by default?
How precise should elevation preference be?
Remember last-used settings?
How many route alternatives to generate?


🚀 Claude Code Starter Prompt
Copy this when you start Claude Code in your project folder:
I'm building a Run Route Generator web app. I have a project brief 
(run-route-generator-project-brief.md) in this directory.

Start by:
1. Reading the project brief
2. Setting up the basic project structure (Node.js + Express)
3. Creating a simple UI with a map display using Leaflet.js
4. Getting a hardcoded test route to display on the map

Follow the same patterns as my Reddit Research Tool - local Node.js 
server that can be tunneled with ngrok for testing.
